### DM-UY 1143 B Ideation and Prototyping
##### Spring 2020 • Katherine Bennett • Mon/Wed 4:30PM-6:20PM • 2 MetroTech, Room 802


_This project can be done as a team or as an individual._

For the final project in this course, you will be creating a speculative design project. Speculative design also goes by many other names. Depending on who you talk to, they might call it: 

* Critical Design
* Design Fiction
* Discursive Design
* Interrogative Design
* Ludic Design

# Future Dystopia / Utopia Project

Imagine our civilization 20 years from now. Things have either collapsed beyond repair or life has become a harmonious dream. Through some crazy combination of wormholes and string theory, you have the opportunity to create a piece of information that will be sent back to the current population. 

* What does your imagined future look, sound, and feel like? (your framing story)

This will involve a deep and a variety of research methods, ideation, development and iteration. Only after this point, will you be best equipt to decide if this is a dystopia or utopia

* What message would you transmit to the current population from the future?

Only after a sustained level of multifacted research, will you begin to be able to tell a story of this world. Since you are creating either a dystopia or utopia, you must send a message back whether it is a warning, suggestion, hope, or blessing, etc.

* You will brainstorm, research, sketch, map, design, and build physical prototypes of an object(s) from your imagined future.


* You will deliver your message (and context of the world) in any final medium(s) you choose. It must include image(s), physical or virtual model(s), or video(s) of your prototyped physical object(s). It must also be a creative endeavor. (Do not even decided how to do this until after the midterm. Otherwise, you are jinxing yourself and making your life more difficult.)


I suggest brainstorming one or more of the following themes to get you started, but you will need to eventually drill down from these very broad themes to specificity:

*   Animals
*   Commerce
*   Education
*   Engineering
*   Ethics
*   Information
*   Materiality
*   Media: Moving Image, Photography, Painting, Print, Sound, etc.
*   Memory
*   Nature
*   Networks
*   Ruins
*   Science
*   Sexuality
*   Systems
*   The Object
*   Technology
*   Time
