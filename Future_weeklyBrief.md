#### Semester Week 4 | Week 2: Future Project Launch

* Create a post that is a written statement regarding what your Future project is going to be about. Where are you at the end of your card sorting? What sort of specific ideas arose from the interplay and ideation of your themes, descriptors and enabler cards?

* Develop the world that your future is. What is your future like? (pick at least 8 to incorporate into your world and write a post on your blog detailing this):
     > government
  > living conditions
   > health
   > food 
   > economy
   > climate
   > shared values
  > work conditions
   >  communication
   > information
   > learning
   > transportation

* Identify Secondary topics, in addtion to your Primary topics for your Future Narrative. Research (and be diverse with your research) these topics. What are some analogous times in history? What are some related discoveries in science, technology, medicine, etc? You can pull from these to inform your story. Begin an annotated bibliography, annotating what you have specifically gained from this source. 4 sources minimum.

* <a href = "narrative_timeline.md">Create a DRAFT timeline for your Future Project, beginning with the present through to your future. *How did this world come into being?* Evidence of your research should be present. This must be clear and readable on your blog.

Create each of the following with regard to the final project, and post to your process site under your Future tab:

* clear visual documentation of the Card Sorting exercise on your process site, along with a written reflection on 3 outcomes that were generated.
* Generate at 2 Mind Maps, further exploring 2 of the possible stories. Go deep and let your mind explore these topics. What else could be explored here? What is related? Post the visuals to your blog along with a written reflection about what was generated and what is developing.

* Take key discoveries that you are gravitating towards from your mind maps, and further explore those explicitly and more deeply through concept maps. Explore the relationships and meanings behind these concepts. This should be larger, explorative and thoughtful.
Post the visuals to your blog along with a written reflection about what was generated and how things have developed.
