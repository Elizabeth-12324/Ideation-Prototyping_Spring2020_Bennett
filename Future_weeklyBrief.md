Create each of the following with regard to the final project, and post to your process site under your Future tab:

* clear visual documentation of the Card Sorting exercise on your process site, along with a written reflection on 3 outcomes that were generated.
* Generate at 2 Mind Maps, further exploring 2 of the possible stories. Go deep and let your mind explore these topics. What else could be explored here? What is related? Post the visuals to your blog along with a written reflection about what was generated and what is developing.
* Take key discoveries that you are gravitating towards from your mind maps, and further explore those explicitly and more deeply through concept maps. Explore the relationships and meanings behind these concepts. This should be larger, explorative and thoughtful.
Post the visuals to your blog along with a written reflection about what was generated and how things have developed.
